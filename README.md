# Project2 - Deep Learning Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of a linear regression model for the Kaggle housing dataset using PyTorch.

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for predicting house prices using linear regression.

## Contents
-  Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- [Sample Data](data/): Sample Kaggle housing dataset files used for training and validation.

## Prerequisites
- Python [version]
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- pandas

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook assignment2.ipynb`
3. Follow the instructions and code in the notebook to explore the linear regression implementation.

## Usage
- The Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step guidance on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for predicting house prices.
- Run each cell in the notebook to see the implementation in action.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters and techniques to enhance the model's performance.

## Results
